<h1>Introduction to Solving a Rubik's Cube</h1>

<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>Notation is very important when learning to solve a Rubik's Cube because you must now how to read
 algorithms off of websites as you are learning the steps to solving the rubiks cube. There are
 many different notations used by different people, especially as you move on to bigger cubes.
However, for the 3x3x3 the notation is pretty standard. Rubiks cube notation essentially assigns
 each face of the cube a letter, and then modifies those letters to represent moves (turns).</p>
<p>Here is an image of the names of each face of the rubiks cube:</p>
<p><img src="http://loki.ist.unomaha.edu/~jtrimm/project/images/turnnotation.png" alt="the front face is F,
the back face is B, the left face is L, the right face is R, the top face (aka the 'up' face) is U,
and the bottom face (aka the 'down' face) is D"></p>

<p>Now that you know the names of each face, the move names should follow pretty simply. A letter on its
own represents turning that letters face clockwise. And a letter with an apostophe represents turning the
letters corresponding face counterclockwise. Note, the clockwise/counterclockwise turns are as if you are
looking at the face straight on.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>I would recommend that you try to work your way though the method outlined above before going on and reading the
    specifics of how to solve this website. A lot of the fun and beauty of the rubiks cube puzzle is that it behaves unlike
    most other puzzles in the world. Working on the rubik's cube on your own will not only preserve some of the wonder
    of solving the cube, but it will also provide you with an important understanding of how the cube works, something that
    will be very useful as you move through this website and through more advanced cube methods.</p>

<h2>Solving the Rubiks Cube</h2>
<p>A common misconception that people have about solving the rubik's cube is that you solve the cube side by side.
This is is not efficient and most people do not do that. Instead, most rubik's cube solvers solve the cube layer by
layer. In this website, you will learn tosolve the cube in the simplest, yet still impresive way. In this method, you
will solve the first layer, then move on to filling in the second layer, and then finally move  on to working
 your way through the last layer.</p>
